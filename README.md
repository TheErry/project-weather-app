# Weather App

The weeks project was to build a Weather App where we were supposed to show the weather in a city with a 5 days forecast.

## The problem

We had some troubble with displaying diffrent days, but we solved it by using the filter method and sorted the temperatures by one single hour per hour. Default response from API is to show several hours each day.
If we had more time we would have added diffrent cities to choose between and changing the color of the font depending on the temperature.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
